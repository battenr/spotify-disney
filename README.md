# spotify-touRney

Started out as a tournament style bracket, similar to March Madness (the NCAA game we all know and love), for Disney soundtracks that we all know and love (Tarzan, A Goofy Movie, The Lion King and much more). What began as a simple excel spreadsheet has turned into this project. Practiced using spotifyR, a package created by Thompson et al. (2021) that is well-thought out. Able to pull Spotify data, using their API and this package to produce what's in store. 


Currently a work in progress (WIP)
